qt-gst-player is a QML plugin (extension) that provides the GstVideo QML
video playback item.

Project Structure
=================

This project consists of two parts:

- The plugin itself, which is built as a library file. This is the primary target
of this project and is the part that is meant to be used in other projects. All
relevant files for the plugin reside in the plugin/ folder.

- A demo application which uses the plugin. All relevant files for the demo
application can be found in the demo/ folder. The demo application is meant to
test the plugin by setting up a minimal QML application with a GstVideo item
inside it and some buttons to test its features and properties.
